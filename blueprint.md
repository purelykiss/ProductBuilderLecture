# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple, interactive lottery number generator. It provides a user-friendly interface to generate a set of random lottery numbers. The application is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and accessible experience.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and works on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Interactive Elements:** It features a "Generate Numbers" button that, when clicked, animates the process of drawing lottery balls.
*   **Visual Appeal:** The interface is designed to be aesthetically pleasing, with custom styles, animations, and a clean layout.
*   **Accessibility:** The application is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

## Current Plan

*   **HTML Structure:** Create the basic HTML structure for the lottery generator, including a title, a container for the numbers, and a button to initiate the draw.
*   **CSS Styling:** Apply modern CSS to style the application, including a responsive layout, custom fonts, colors, and animations for the lottery balls.
*   **JavaScript Logic:** Implement the JavaScript functionality to generate six unique random numbers between 1 and 45 when the user clicks the button. The numbers will be displayed with a slight delay and an animation to simulate a real draw.
